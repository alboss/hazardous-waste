# React Bootstrap with Material Design

MDBootstrap for React

## Housekeeping

App.js has the site building blocks, i.e. header (including navigation and logo), footer, etc.

Replace logo.png with the right logo image

Routes.js builds the navigation

Alter or create the .js under /src/pages for each page

## Getting Started

To test, contribute or just see what we did follow few easy steps:

- clone the repository
- cd to the directory with the repository
- run `yarn install` (or `npm install` if you don't use yarn)
- run the app using `yarn start` (or `npm start`)
- to build project use `yarn run build` (od `npm run build`)
- `yarn run remove-demo` (or `npm run remove-demo`) removes demo app pages
